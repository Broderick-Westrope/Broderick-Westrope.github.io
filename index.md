Hi, my name is
# Broderick Westrope

I’m a Sydney-based Computer Science student who is passionate about many aspects of software development, especially algorithm design.

## About Me

Hi! My name’s Broderick, and I enjoy creating things that make your everyday digital life possible. My love for programming first started back in 2014 when I decided to make a game in [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) just cause my friends were. I ended up making a pretty cool Mario ripoff where you can change gravity, but beyond that, I had just taken my first step in learning the core principles of programming like logic, object-oriented programming, and the use of variables.

Skip a few years and lots of debugging and you arrive at where are today. I’m a qualified game developer, pursuing my long-term goal of completing a Bachelor of Computer Science at the University of Western Sydney. Along the way, I’ve had the honor of meeting lots of great people and learning life skills in environments like [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/).

Here are a few technologies I’ve been using lately:

 [x] Python
 [x] C++
 [x] C#
 [x] Unity
 [x] TypeScript

## Projects

### Mario 64 Remake:
Inspired by [Nimso Ny’s](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgQlIfKzMdicB4vE69JjW_A) remake of the first level of Mario 64, I decided to attempt to remake it with my own twist using Unity and open-source models.

<div style="text-align: right"> This is a game I started creating after coming up with the idea while at TAFE. The main repository/project hasn’t been updated in some time as I am in a phase of testing and getting feedback. I hope to someday release it as an indie game. </div>


### Game of Hex, Chess, and Crazy-House:
As part of an assignment for University, I had to create a command-line based version of Game of Hex that had several AI opponents. This really intrigued me and I wanted to push myself further with the concept so I teamed up with a fellow student, Joshua Meadows, to make chess with AI opponents of varying difficulty. Currently, I have made the base game that runs on the command-line for a simple environment to create the AI while Joshua learns front-end development. After making chess, I aspire to use the knowledge gained to make a variation called Crazy-House.


## Get In Touch

I'm now in my final year of my Bachelor of Computer Science and am looking for what may come next. If you would like to discuss an opportunity then I would love to hear from you.
